# ✈️ Air Passengers Data Analysis - Time Series Analysis

# Dataset Informtion
This project is about studying the Air Passengers dataset.
I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to understand how the number of passengers changes every month and every year.

# 📌 Business Problem

Airlines need to know how many people will travel in the future.
This helps them plan flights, manage staff, and set ticket prices.

This project helps by finding:

How passenger numbers are growing

Which months have more passengers

Which months have fewer passengers

The long-term trend in air travel

# Process of Analysing the Datasets

Loaded the dataset

Checked the data

Made graphs and charts

Found trends and seasonal patterns

Explained the results in simple words

# 📈 Outcomes of Analysis

Passengers are increasing every year

Some months have high travel (seasonal peak)

Some months have low travel

Useful for planning and forecasting

# 🛠 Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

# Algorithms
