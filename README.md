## ✈️ Project Title

Air Passengers Time Series Analysis & Forecasting using Python


## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze historical air passenger data to identify long-term trends, seasonality, and growth patterns.
The project also aims to prepare the data for forecasting future passenger demand to support airline capacity and planning decisions.


## Dataset Informtion

This project is about studying the Air Passengers dataset.
I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to understand how the number of passengers changes every month and every year.


## 📌 Business Problem

Airlines need to know how many people will travel in the future.
This helps them plan flights, manage staff, and set ticket prices.

This project helps by finding:

1️⃣ Is air passenger traffic increasing over time?

Yes, the data shows a clear upward trend, indicating continuous growth in air travel demand over the years.


2️⃣ Is there seasonality in passenger traffic?

Yes, strong seasonal patterns are present, with passenger peaks during mid-year and holiday periods.


3️⃣ Are fluctuations stable over time?

Answer:
No, the variance increases over time, indicating multiplicative seasonality, not constant fluctuations.


4️⃣ Is the time series stationary?

The original series is non-stationary due to trend and seasonality and requires transformation (log/differencing).


5️⃣ What transformations improve stationarity?

Log transformation and differencing reduce variance and help achieve stationarity for modeling.


6️⃣ Can future passenger demand be forecasted?

Yes, after preprocessing, the data can be used for time-series forecasting models such as ARIMA/SARIMA.


## Process of Analysing the Datasets

Loaded the dataset

Checked the data

Made graphs and charts

Found trends and seasonal patterns

Explained the results in simple words


## 📈 Outcomes of Analysis

Passengers are increasing every year

Some months have high travel (seasonal peak)

Some months have low travel

Useful for planning and forecasting

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

🔧 Tools

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – Time-series handling

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization

Statsmodels – Time series analysis

## 🧠 Skills

Time Series Analysis

Trend & Seasonality Detection

Stationarity Testing

Data Transformation

Forecasting Concepts

Analytical Thinking


## 📊 Key Insights (Short & Clear)

Air travel demand is steadily increasing

Strong seasonality exists every year

Variance grows with time → multiplicative behavior

Data must be transformed before forecasting

Historical patterns help predict future demand


## 💡 Business Recommendations

Airlines should increase capacity during peak seasons

Use forecasting models for better route planning

Apply dynamic pricing during high-demand months

Plan maintenance during low-traffic periods

Use historical trends for long-term growth planning
